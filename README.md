# RetinalOCT
Retinal OCT Image Classification using CNNs and ResNet50

This project focuses on developing an automated deep learning-based system for classifying Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into four categories: Normal, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Drusen. OCT imaging plays a critical role in diagnosing retinal conditions; however, manual interpretation is labor intensive and susceptible to errors. To address these challenges, the study utilized a dataset of 84,495 labeled OCT images, applying preprocessing and data augmentation techniques such as normalization, rotation, and zooming.
