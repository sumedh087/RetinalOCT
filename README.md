# RetinalOCT
Retinal OCT Image Classification using CNNs and ResNet50

This project focuses on developing an automated deep learning-based system for classifying Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into four categories: Normal, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Drusen. OCT imaging plays a critical role in diagnosing retinal conditions; however, manual interpretation is labor intensive and susceptible to errors. To address these challenges, the study utilized a dataset of 84,495 labeled OCT images, applying preprocessing and data augmentation techniques such as normalization, rotation, and zooming.

Two model architectures were explored: a pre-trained ResNet50 model and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The ResNet50 model, leveraging pre trained features, achieved superior performance with a test accuracy of 99.34% and a test loss of 0.033, outperforming the custom CNN model, which attained a test accuracy of 97.21% and a test loss of 0.106. Class wise evaluation revealed higher precision, recall, and F1-scores for ResNet50, particularly in categories with overlapping features, such as CNV and DME. ResNet50â€™s robustness was further validated through confusion matrix analysis and ROC curve evaluation, which showed AUC values close to 1.0 across all categories.
